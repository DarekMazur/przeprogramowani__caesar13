A quick look at the top-level files and directories in project.

    .
    ├── dist
    ├── src
    ├── index.html
    ├── package.json
    └── README.md
    
* **`/dist`**: This directory contains production build.

* **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

* **`index.html`**: Main application file.

* **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

* **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.
